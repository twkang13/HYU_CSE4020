>> UI for control point specification

onMouseButton():
    * If the cursor clicked on the cow, set the cursor fixed on the cow.
    * Save all the positions of the contol points.

onMouseClick():
    * If the cursor clicked on the ground, set the cursor free.

onMouseDrag():
    * If the cursor clicked on the ground, set the cursor free.

display():
    * Draw all the cows in cowPosition if the number of click is less then 6.
    * Draw the cow rollercoster if the number of click is 6.
    * If the cow rollercoaster is finished, initialize the number of click and cowPosition to get new control points.


>> vertical dragging

onMouseDrag():
    * create a dragging plane perpendicular to the ray direction (x-axis).
    * Set a Y which only has a change of vertical position value.
    * Set a T with translation matrix Y.
    * Apply the change of vertical position to cow2wld with T.


>> cyclic B-spline curve

display():
    * Get four control points by using the time that the cow has been rollercoaster.
    * Save the result of bSpline to cowPosition.

bSpline():
    * Calculate the position of the cow with the given control points.
    * Implemented by using cubic B-spline curve.


>> Rotation

display():
    * Get the rotation angle by using the translation value 
    * of cow2wld (previous cow position) and cowMatrix (current cow position).
    * Save the result of rotation to cow2wld.

getEulerAngle():
    * Calculate the rotation angle by using the translation value

    * Set yaw by using the arctan2 function with argument x, z.
    * Decrement yaw by 90 degrees to make the cow face the z-axis.
    * Set rotation matrix with yaw.

    * Set pitch by using the arctan2 function with argument x, y, z
    * Set rotation matrix with pitch.

    * return the result of yaw and pitch.
